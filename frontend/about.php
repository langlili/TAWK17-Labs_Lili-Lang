            <p>Since the beginning of time, humans have lived as one, while thinking, creating, reading, writing
                - all in the name of sophistication. In 1999, Mark Zuckerberg founded a library - the very library
                in which your right now untangibly stand in. He called it "Redoing Labs" - 
                because Mark was a scholar of his time and was constantly redoing labs. Amazing, huh?
            </p>
            <p>Keep scrolling this page and you may, or may not, find out more about each member of
                this sacred book club. It really depends on how relevant it is. But then again... 
                Is anything really of relevance?
            </p>
            <p>Now what can you do in this space-time continuum? That is something we want to answer. Some day. 
                For now, maybe you would just like to fill that little empty space in your heart, with 
                words in plenty. That is what we can give you. Because we love you. 
            </p>
            <p>Continue to search our limited-edition library (and it is indeed quite limited) in this
                humble space that we call "Redoing Labs". Maybe one day, just like Zuckerberg, you can 
                become a meme too.
